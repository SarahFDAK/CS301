# CS301 Project
This is meant to be a text game version of the game Calvinball from the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes. The nature of the game makes it difficult to function as a traditional text game, but the challenge of incorporating assembly is much of the goal.
The concept is that the user is given a random rule (from a list of rules stored in an assembly file) and a tool from a list stored in a different assembly file. They must then choose an action to take them to their next turn, which generates another rule and tool.
